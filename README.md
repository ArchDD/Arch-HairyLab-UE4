UE4 project for character hair generation

This project is currently a proof-of-concept, more information to come when progress has been made

## Intended use:
1. Quickly prototyping polygonal hair that is exported to be mastered on some professional 3D application
2. Adding further customisation for characters at runtime, allowing users to edit
